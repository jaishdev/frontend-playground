# 🛠️ Back-End Learning (Node + Express + MongoDB)

This folder is for my **back-end development learning**.

I’m focusing on:

- **Node.js** – to run JavaScript on the server
- **Express.js** – to build APIs and handle routes
- **MongoDB** – to store and manage data
- **TypeScript** – learning it slowly with Node when needed

## 📁 What’s Inside

The folder names might change as I learn more, but for now:

- `node/` – Basics of Node.js and working with files, modules, etc.
- `express/` – API routes, middleware, RESTful services
- `mongodb/` – MongoDB setup, Mongoose, CRUD operations
- `projects/` – Backend or full APIs built with Node + Express + MongoDB

> TypeScript might be mixed into the folders if I try it with backend.

## 🎯 Goal

To learn how to create real APIs, connect to databases, and build full working backends for my projects.

I’ll keep updating this folder as I learn more about the backend side 🚀
