# ⚡ Front-End Learning (JS + React + TS)

This folder has everything I’m learning about **front-end development**.

I’m focusing on:

- **JavaScript** – to make websites interactive
- **React** – to build modern apps
- **TypeScript** – learning along the way with JS and React

I also use **HTML** and **CSS** when needed, mostly inside my projects.

## 📁 What’s Inside

Folder names might change as I keep learning, but for now:

- `javascript/` – Practice code, logic building, and small apps
- `react/` – React concepts, components, hooks, and projects
- `projects/` – Front-end mini projects using JS and React

> TypeScript code is inside JavaScript or React files, not in a separate folder (for now).

## 🎯 Goal

To get better at writing clean code, build real apps, and understand how front-end works step by step.

I’ll keep adding more as I learn 🚀
