# 🌟 My FullStack Learning Repo

This is my folder where I keep everything I’m learning about **full-stack development**.

I’m learning **front-end** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) and **back-end** (Node.js, Express, MongoDB). Inside this folder, you will see more folders for each topic.

## 📁 What’s Inside

- `JavaScript/` – My JavaScript notes, practice, and small programs
- `React/` – React basics, components, hooks, and small apps
- `Node/` – Backend code using Node.js
- `Express/` – My Express.js projects and examples
- `MongoDB/` – Working with databases using MongoDB
- `FullStack Projects/` – Apps I made using both front-end and back-end
- `Challenges/` – Code problems and my answers

## 📝 Why I Made This

- To **practice full-stack development**
- To **remember what I learn**
- To **track my progress** and see how I improve

## 🎯 What I’m Doing Now

- Learning **React and backend together**
- Building small **full-stack projects**
- Improving my coding skills step by step
